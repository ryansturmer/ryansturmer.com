Title: Tree Climbing St Louis
Date: 2014-10-07 10:51 PM

In the last couple of years, Katie has been getting into recreational tree climbing, which is something that I never thought I would do myself, and even offered some resistance to when Katie brought me into the fold last year.  We had our second "Rendezvous" with the national club last week, and I have to say it's a great activity, and I'm enjoying it more each time I do it.

Recreational Climbing
---------------------
Recreational tree climbers essentially employ many of the same techniques that professional arborists use to get up into tree canopies for doing "tree work" (The collective term for pruning, removing dead branches, performing kitten rescue, etc.)  Like rock climbing, tree climbing is done with ropes and harnesses, the climber relying on their strength, technique, and equipment to carry them safely into the trees.  Also much like rock climbers, tree climbers get into the hobby for a variety of reasons, prominently including physical fitness and a love of the outdoors.  Unlike rock climbing however, the overwhelming majority of tree climbers seem to seek a personal connection to the trees themselves.  Frequently, the climb isn't as much the focus of the activity as the destination.  More than *making it to the treetops* the recreational climber wants to *be in the treetops* the environment of the forest canopy is unique, and the right to spend time in it is its own reward.

Recreational Climbers (Treeple)
-------------------------------
Surprisingly, many recreational climbers are also arborists.  It seemed a little absurd to me at first that someone who is a professional tree worker would want to spend any of their free time at all in the trees.  Tree work is dangerous and demanding, and I kind of figured most arborists would rather kick back with a beer in their spare time than further risk their lives climbing a hundred feet up in the forest canopy.

On the other hand, I'm an engineer, all day, every day, and when I get home at night, *a lot of times thats what I do there as well.*  I'm called to it, much as many arborists are called to the canopy.  One Arborist I spoke to said that the main difference between "tree work" and "tree play" is that when you're climbing recreationally, you can look up at a tree and say, "Nope."  Being an arborist essentially means you're spending your days in the *worst trees* where as when you're climbing recreationally, you're in the trees on your terms, in your own place, on your own time.

The recreational climbing community is a fun bunch.  Dorks, the lot of them,  united in a sort of collective tree dorkiness, but each participant unique in their own dorky focus.  Some obsess over knots, some over gear, many over the trees themselves and their inhabitants.  Some climb for research, for fun, or for a spiritual experience, but nearly everyone is warm and nice, and everyone who climbs shares their knowledge freely.  At the St. Louis meetup, Katie and I attended a number of events, learned new knots, hitches, climbing techniques and terms, all from people who essentially volunteered to teach because they're huge dorks about it, and talking about climbing is what they live for.

Climbing Concepts
-----------------

There are about as many ways to climb as there are climbers.  Everyone seems to have a different "climbing system" which is a combination of ropes, knots, gear, and techniques that allows one to ascend, descend and traverse in the canopy.  I would have guessed that there were a couple of "standard" ways to climb that were used by everyone, but that couldn't be further from the truth.  Everyone's system is subtly different, and most climbers treat their climbing recipe with a sort of curatorial zeal that I thought was reserved for competition bakers and distillers of fine spirits.  I could go on and on here about the theory of climbing, but I'll just do a glancing overview.  There are plenty of great resources out there, and the fact is, I'm not a very experienced climber, and couldn't in any way do it justice here.

Double rope technique, which is how Katie and I climb, essentially involves throwing a rope over a branch, tying it in a sort of noose, and clipping the knot of the noose into your harness.  By tightening the noose (with some effort!) you ascend, until you reach the target branch.  There are techniques once in the tree for traversal from branch to branch that involve using the tail end of your rope to  repeat the process, allowing you to move about the tree with (relative) ease.  DRT is how beginners get started, but many more experienced climbers use it as well because it's safe, approachable, and cost effective.

Single rope technique is used by more advanced climbers, as it is generally used for higher ascents, and is more gear intensive.  As the name implies, the single rope climber sets one one rope and climbs using a combination of ascent/descent equipment and more finely tuned friction hitches. One of the key advantages of SRT is that it only requires half the rope that DRT requires for an ascent of the same height.  For this reason it is favored by professionals who don't want to lug a lot of rope around, and researchers who climb really tall trees.

Speaking of researchers that climb really tall trees, here's  something that blows my mind about that.  The great redwood trees in the old growth forests of the west are routinely over 300 feet tall.  Research climbs of these trees are done but the logistics of such climbs are complicated for a couple of reasons.  First of all, it's impractical to lug around 800 feet of rope for a climb, and besides that, setting a branch at over 300 feet from the ground is impossible. (Remember, we're throwing a line over a branch here, from the ground.)  The way these trees are climbed is that the lowest branches are set with a climbing line, that branch is climbed, and then another setting is done at a higher branch.  This process is repeated until the desired height is reached. Because of the amount of rope involved, this means that for some climbs, when you are in the canopy, you actually do not have enough rope to get back to the ground.  To reach the ground, you descend to a previously set branch, drop another rope, test it, pull in your previous descent line, and repeat until you reach the ground.  Crazy!  The photo above depicts Katie in a sycamore tree, at a height of about 75 feet.  This is about as high as our ropes will take us using DRT.  It's high enough for me, for now.
