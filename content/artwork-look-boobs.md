Title: Artwork: "Look boobs" (King's Quest II) 
Date: 2014-12-30 1:44 PM

My good and long-time friend Aaron Brown, who never fails to be anything but an interesting character gave me a pair of paintings one night that were given to him by a friend.  They aren't bad paintings, but are fairly unremarkable as far as paintings go.   These are the sorts of inoffensive works that you can pick up at the thrift shop if you are vigilant, and although they are well done, don't really bring a lot of excitement to a room, unless your idea of excitement is looking at a picture of a beach.

I have made a hobby in the last few years of taking such paintings and attempting to breathe new life into them by painting in characters from my favorite video games.  I have done about half a dozen such works by now, and when Aaron gave me the paintings, he said this:

_"Paint them both, and give me back the one you like less"_

This is the core of Aarons subtle brilliance.  We had consumed a few beers, and I said "Sure!  Thanks, man!" and loaded the paintings into my car.  It wasn't until the morning that I realized that he had given away essentially nothing of value to him, in exchange for a customized piece of artwork from me.  Brilliant.

The Painting
------------

I have finished both paintings.  The one which I'm about to return to Aaron is shown below:

In case you're unfamiliar with the source material, it is a scene from [King's Quest Two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_II) which was, in my view, one of the best of the series.  The scene is one that is familiar to anyone who played it, in particular, any male who played it when he was ten.  The graphical-text adventure format provoked many scenes of this sort, where the immature player commands the game to do something lewd, with the game (usually) responding with a snarky retort.  I considered actually painting the snarky retort, but to do it justice, it would have to have been a dialog box that took up much of the painting, and made the overall experience less fun.  Instead, this is the moment just before the **enter** key is struck, the game's response still a mystery.

Features
--------
I am not a professional artist (obviously) and have no formal artistic training nor do I practice enough to even be considered proficient.  There are however a few parts of each painting, of which I am particularly proud.  (At least of the paintings that I choose to share here.)

This rock is cool, mainly because (in this close up it's rather obvious) the original painting was torn here, and I had to patch it from behind with a scrap piece of canvas.  I think when people restore old paintings they typically sew the canvas back together, but I don't really know how to do that, so I just glued a patch on the back, filled the tear with gesso, and once it set up, painted a rock over it so it was less obvious that the painting had been damaged.

The mermaid, in all her sexy glory, is not very interesting herself, but I'm proud of how I managed to get the waves to splash up on her rock.  It's a pain to match the colors of the original painting like that, but I'm getting better at it.

Same thing here.  King Graham isn't all that fantastic by himself, but I was happy to be able to get the beach grasses painted over him in a way that looked like they matched the original painting.
