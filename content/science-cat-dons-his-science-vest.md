Title: Science Cat Dons his Science Vest
Date: 2014-12-09 10:46 PM

Just a quick note about our cat Edison, who is (as of today) a frontiersman in the annals of _cat science._  Edison will be working with the [Cat Tracker Project](http://cats.yourwildlife.org/) through [NCSU](http://www.ncsu.edu/) and the [North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences](http://naturalsciences.org)  Katie found out about this project many months ago and signed us up to get a tracker for Edison, and we had all but forgotten about it until this past week, when we were emailed about our inclusion in the program.

The Science Vest
----------------
Edison's science vest is outfitted with a GPS receiver, with enough battery and non-volatile memory to store 5 days worth of data.  Edison has been harnessed up, but the tracking will not start for 24 hours, to give him time to adjust to the vest.  I didn't expect him to have as much trouble with it as he has.  Although the device is light and not terribly snug, he doesn't appear to agree with the extra weight, and for an hour or so after we fitted him with the tracker, he kind of just sat in one place on the floor.  He would take an experimental step occasionally, but the vest seems very disorienting to him at first.

The full duration of the program is two weeks, but owing to the limited battery life of the harness, the scientists who are observing him will be dropping by every few days to swap out the data loggers, both to collect the accumulated data, and to provide fresh battery life to the collar.  It's difficult to see in the photos, but the tracker is an off-the-shelf unit, and it is fitted to a normal cat harness with a 3D-Printed fixture that holds it in place during normal use, but makes it easy to remove with a pen or something so it can be swapped for a fresh one at regular intervals.

Cat Habits
----------
Part of me has the expectation that the tracker will reveal a rich and varied life that Edison leads at some great distance from our home.  He loves to go outside, and it would be sort of exciting to find out that he spends his free time exploring miles away from here.  On the other hand, Edison is essentially a lazy blob around the house.  He's not a fat cat by any stretch, and is in fact lean and muscular, but I wouldn't exactly call him _energetic._ He's got a heart murmur and he loves his mommy (My wife Katie, pictured above) and I may be disappointed (but unsurprised) to find at the end of the study that when he goes outside he just hangs out under the shed, or goes across the street to eat the neighbor's dog food.

Results and Further Work
------------------------
The laboratory doing the study may also collect some of Edison's hair, as well as a sample of his cat food to do an analysis of his diet.  Supposedly, by examining the composition of his fur, and comparing it to the composition of his food, they can determine how much of what Edison eats comes from us, and how much comes from external sources (hunting, foraging, and feeding by other families)

For this first part of the program, I'll be receiving KML files that detail Edison's wanderings for the duration of the two-week study.  I will report the results here when the data comes in.
