Title: First Post 
Date: 2014-09-23 11:36 AM

I never know what to say on the first post, and it seems like I have a lot of first posts, because I keep ripping up my website and rebuilding it, without ever saying anything truly substantive.  Today is my birthday, and hopefully I can kick off the next year of life by changing that habit.  This site is powered by [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) which I'm pretty happy with so far, mainly because it's really simple.  I'm still working on the theme, but my configuration makes it really easy to write, which may provoke me to do it more.

So if you're here to learn about me, you can poke around a little, although there's not much here.  You'll find more at the social media links provided than you will here, but hopefully I'll change that soon.

*I've got things to say, dammit.  I do!  Projects to document, hobbies to photograph.  It'll all be here, folks.*

Cheers,
