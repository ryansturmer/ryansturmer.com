## Experience

__Senior Engineer – Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc. (2005-2013)__

_Worked on a diverse team of scientists engineers and businesspeople to bring a novel electrostatics-based microfluidic technology to market in the field of point-of-care diagnostics._

* Developed novel high voltage (up to 300V) analog and mixed signal circuits for electrostatic manipulation of liquid droplets on a microfluidic platform.
* Invented novel techniques for performing electrical measurements on liquid droplets.
* Developed above into working core features of a diagnostic product.
* Developed and laboratory measurement products with a broad range of functionality:
* Mechnical/electromechanical: solenoid, stepper motor, DC and servo motor systems
* Optical: Photomultiplier (PMT), photodiode, and LED-based fluorimetric systems
* Thermal: Thermal control via resistive heating, peltier heating/cooling
* Embedded: Microcontroller systems with a broad range of control/measurement functionality
* Designed novel inter-operating embedded firmware/PC software architecture for executing laboratory protocols in a microfluidic platform.
* Developed scripting library for scheduling droplet operations on a microfluidic platform.
* Developed numerous software tools for internal applications such as data management, automated
and interactive testing, data analysis and process simulation
* Interacted with multiple contract manufacturers to bring designs into production.
* Managed IT infrastructure for up to 30 employees, using Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Exchange,
Active Directory
* Managed the hand-off of IT operations to external IT contractor as company grew. Remained as point
of contact and assisted with specifying hardware, purchasing, and defining requirements for infrastructure growth. Eventually managed to transfer 100% of responsibility to IT contractor and administrative staff!
* Set up and maintained a (windows) development server for a team of dozens of scientists and engineers, based on open-source productivity and configuration management tools, including SVN, phpBB, TRAC, Apache, PostgreSQL - as well as a number of internally-developed tools for laboratory information management, inventory, and software licensing.

__Engineer – Glaxosmithkline : Protein Crystallography (2005)__
