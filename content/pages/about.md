About Me
========
My name is Ryan Sturmer and I'm a freelance electronic designer/software engineer from Durham, North Carolina where I currently live with my wife Katie and our three cats Gidget, Edison and Ganymede.  I am very enthusiastic about hardware and software design, but also enjoy games of all types, music, painting, bee husbandry, cooking, welding, woodworking, hiking/tree climbing, gardening and more.
